# CMPM121 "Zombie" Classroom
1. What is your scene?
   My scene is a music classroom in a school in another universe which got attacked by zombies. I didn't want to make the scene "bloody" and "R18" for this assignment so I didn't put any blood or zombie models in it (yet?). I tried to present the chaos by having objects scattered around the room falling down, and the tables blocking the door. The instruments scattered around (piano, guitar, amplifier, maracas on the ground) indicates this is a music room, and the school bags and the blackboard shows it's in a school. 
2. What kinds of objects did you include?
   As I mentioned a bit above, I included instruments including piano, guitar, amplifier, maracas, and also a pair of speakers to show the musicality. The table, desk, blackboard, backpacks, broken pencils on the ground, and a clock on the wall all shows that this is a classroom. I also put a door and 2 windows to make it like an actual room - everything I implemented into the scene was to try making this scene realistic and persuasive. 
3. Did anything inspire you?
   Last year I watched a Korean TV series on Netflix called "All of Us are Dead", which is about highschool kids trapped on their campus and tried to escape due to zombie attacks. The story plot of this series is not really good (personally to me XD), but I really liked the scene design. There is a music classroom in that TV series, and there is a piano fell down in the corner with a zombie under it. I think this is pretty iconic so I tried to mimic a similar sceneary. 
4. What is the main character in the scene?
   The main character is obviously the girl in the corner with the T-pose XD. As you switch between the cameras, most of the cameras are focused on her. I didn't mean to find a female model with that little cloth on (I'm not offensing people who wear a little, I'm just trying to say that I'm not a pervert or someone strange XD), this is the only personally acceptable free model that I found on either TurboSquid or CGTrader.
